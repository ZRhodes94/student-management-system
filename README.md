# student-management-system
Capstone project for MS in Software Development

The purpose of this student management system (SMS) is to attempt to correct some of the challenges that are present in current SMSs. As a teacher for the past five years, I have used several SMSs- these current systems are not built for ease of use or convienienece. My goal is to create the foundation, or a MVP, that meets the needs of students and teachers alike. Looking at student grades as a parent should not be a difficult process. The current difficulty limits the number of parents that do track their student's progress. Similarly- many teachers, old and new, struggle with the systems. How do you pull reports? How do you create a new assignment? We live in an age of technology- where life is supposed to be aided by the software and systems we use. In education, SMSs do not currently meet the modern standards. I would like to work to develop something that fits these needs.
